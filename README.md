# InstagramPureFeed

Motivated by the exhaustion of logging into Instagram and being bombarded with content unrelated to my friends, I created InstagramPureFeed. This is an extension that purifies the Instagram feed by removing reels, suggestions, and any other distracting content, allowing you to see only your friends' posts.

> **Note:** Currently, only the functionality to remove account suggestions is working.


## Compatibility

As of the latest update, this extension has been tested and confirmed to work on:

- **Google Chrome** on **macOS**

Future updates will aim to expand compatibility to other browsers and operating systems. Please feel free to contribute by testing and reporting issues or suggesting fixes for other platforms.
