# InstagramPureFeed

Motivated by the exhaustion of logging into Instagram and being bombarded with content unrelated to my friends, I created InstagramPureFeed. This is an extension that purifies the Instagram feed by removing reels, suggestions, and any other distracting content, allowing you to see only your friends' posts.

> **Note:** Currently, only the functionality to remove account suggestions is working.
